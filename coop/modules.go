// Module is a common interface for all subsystem coordinators so that the core routine can manage them in a
// consistent manner. The interface provides a way to configure the coordinator, and then methods to start it and stop
// it safely. It is expected that when any of these funcs are called, the coordinator will then call the corresponding
// func on its modules.
//
// The struct that implements this interface is expected to have an App and Log literal, at the very least. The App
// literal will contain the protocol.ApplicationContext object with resources that the coordinator and modules may use.
// The Log literal will be set up with a logger that has fields set that identify the coordinator. These are set up by
// the core routine before Configure is called. The coordinator can use Log to create the individual loggers for the
// modules it controls.
